# 🎉 SUCCESS! Both Backend and Frontend are Now Running!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Backend Naming Conflict ✅ SOLVED
**Problem:** `Route` class conflicted with ASP.NET Core's built-in routing `Route` class

**Solution:** Renamed domain model from `Route` to `BusRoute`

**Files Modified:**
- `Models/Route.cs` → Renamed class to `BusRoute`
- `Models/Schedule.cs` → Updated navigation property
- `Data/BusReservationDbContext.cs` → Updated all references

### Issue 2: Frontend Angular Configuration ✅ SOLVED
**Problem:** `angular.json` was missing required `browserTarget` property in serve configuration

**Solution:** Added `options` object with `browserTarget` property

**Files Modified:**
- `angular.json` → Added proper serve configuration with `browserTarget`
- `tsconfig.spec.json` → Created missing test configuration file
