## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### 1. ❌ WRONG TECHNOLOGY STACK (-15 pts)
- **Have:** .NET 8 + SQL Server LocalDB
- **Need:** .NET 9 + PostgreSQL
- **Impact:** Explicit requirement - immediate points deduction

### 2. ❌ NO CLEAN ARCHITECTURE (-15 pts)
- **Have:** Single monolithic BusReservation.API project
- **Need:** 5 separate projects:
  - BusReservation.Domain
  - BusReservation.Application
  - BusReservation.Application.Contracts
  - BusReservation.Infrastructure
  - BusReservation.WebApi
  - BusReservation.Tests
- **Impact:** Core architectural requirement - MAJOR points lost

### 3. ❌ NO UNIT TESTS (-15 pts)
- **Have:** 0 tests
- **Need:** 20+ xUnit tests covering:
  - Booking available seats
  - Booking unavailable seats
  - Seat status updates
  - Search functionality
- **Impact:** Testing is 15-20% of grade - CRITICAL

### 4. ❌ NO VIDEO DEMO (-5 pts)
- **Have:** Nothing
- **Need:** 3-5 minute video showing:
  - Architecture overview
  - System workflow (Search → View Seats → Booking)
  - Unit test execution
- **Impact:** Required deliverable

### 5. ⚠️ INCOMPLETE DDD (-5 pts)
- **Have:** Basic POCO entities
- **Need:** Full DDD patterns:
  - Value Objects
  - Domain Services
  - Aggregates
  - Domain Events
- **Impact:** Design quality

## 🎯 WHAT EVALUATORS WILL SAY

### ✅ Good Points
> "Great functional system! Real-time updates work perfectly. UI is professional and responsive. Angular implementation is solid. Booking flow is smooth."

### ❌ Bad Points
> "**CRITICAL:** Wrong technology stack (.NET 8 instead of 9, SQL Server instead of PostgreSQL). **CRITICAL:** Not following Clean Architecture - it's a monolithic project. **CRITICAL:** Zero unit tests - this is unacceptable for a software architecture assignment. Missing DDD patterns completely. No video demo. This is a working prototype, not a production-quality submission."

### Result
> **Score: 65-70/100 (Failing grade due to architecture and testing)**

Full Compliance:    95/100 (A)  - All requirements met (18-20 hours)
Ready to Submit:    ❌ NO       - 14-20 hours of work needed
```

## 🎓 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Don't submit yet!** You'll get a failing grade on architecture and testing.

**Instead:**
1. Spend this week implementing:
   - Unit tests (START NOW)
   - Clean Architecture restructure
   - .NET 9 + PostgreSQL migration
2. Record video demo
3. Final push to GitHub
4. Then submit with confidence

**Timeline:** 3-5 focused days of development

**Result:** A-range grade (90-95%) instead of C-range (65-70%)
