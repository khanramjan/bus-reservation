# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The build was failing with the error:
```
'Route' is an ambiguous reference between 'BusReservation.API.Models.Route' and 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Route'
```

## Root Cause
The `Route` class name in our domain models conflicted with ASP.NET Core's built-in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Route` class, causing a naming collision.

## Solution Applied
Renamed the domain model from `Route` to `BusRoute` to avoid the naming conflict.

## Files Modified

### 1. **Models/Route.cs**
- Renamed class from `Route` to `BusRoute`

### 2. **Models/Schedule.cs**
- Updated navigation property type from `Route` to `BusRoute`

### 3. **Data/BusReservationDbContext.cs**
- Updated `DbSet<Route>` to `DbSet<BusRoute>`
- Updated entity configuration for `BusRoute`
- Updated seed data to use `BusRoute` instead of `Route`

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

### Database Status: ✅ CREATED
- Migrations created successfully
- Database updated successfully
- Seed data inserted:
  - 4 Buses
  - 4 Routes
  - 4 Schedules for tomorrow

### API Status: ✅ RUNNING
- Backend running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Swagger available at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
- CORS configured for Angular frontend

## Next Steps for Frontend

1. Navigate to Frontend folder:
   ```powershell
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

The Angular app will open at `http://localhost:4200` and will be able to communicate with the backend API.

## Alternative Quick Start

Simply run the batch files:
- **Backend**: Double-click `start-backend.bat`
- **Frontend**: Double-click `start-frontend.bat`

✅ All backend errors have been resolved!
✅ Database is ready with sample data!
✅ API is configured and tested!
