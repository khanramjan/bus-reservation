## ðŸš€ How to Apply Database Changes:

Since the backend is currently running, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Stop Backend & Update Database
1. **Stop the backend** (Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
2. Run these commands:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Projects\wafisolution\Backend\BusReservation.API
   dotnet ef database drop --force
   dotnet ef migrations add UpdateToBangladeshiData
   dotnet ef database update
   dotnet run
   ```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Update (Quickest)
Keep the backend running and update the database directly:

```sql
-- Update Buses
UPDATE Buses SET BusNumber = 'DH-11-5678', BusName = 'Green Line Paribahan', BasePrice = 1200 WHERE BusId = 1;
UPDATE Buses SET BusNumber = 'CH-15-9012', BusName = 'Shyamoli Paribahan', BasePrice = 800 WHERE BusId = 2;
UPDATE Buses SET BusNumber = 'DH-12-3456', BusName = 'Hanif Enterprise', BasePrice = 1000 WHERE BusId = 3;
UPDATE Buses SET BusNumber = 'RJ-10-7890', BusName = 'Ena Transport', BasePrice = 1400 WHERE BusId = 4;

-- Update Routes
UPDATE Routes SET Source = 'Dhaka', Destination = 'Rajshahi', Distance = 256, EstimatedDuration = '06:00:00' WHERE RouteId = 1;
UPDATE Routes SET Source = 'Dhaka', Destination = 'Chittagong', Distance = 264, EstimatedDuration = '07:00:00' WHERE RouteId = 2;
UPDATE Routes SET Source = 'Dhaka', Destination = 'Cox''s Bazar', Distance = 400, EstimatedDuration = '10:00:00' WHERE RouteId = 3;
UPDATE Routes SET Source = 'Dhaka', Destination = 'Sylhet', Distance = 245, EstimatedDuration = '06:00:00' WHERE RouteId = 4;

-- Update Schedules
UPDATE Schedules SET Price = 1250, ArrivalTime = DATEADD(HOUR, 6, DepartureTime) WHERE ScheduleId = 1;
UPDATE Schedules SET Price = 850, ArrivalTime = DATEADD(HOUR, 7, DepartureTime) WHERE ScheduleId = 2;
UPDATE Schedules SET Price = 1100, ArrivalTime = DATEADD(HOUR, 10, DepartureTime) WHERE ScheduleId = 3;
UPDATE Schedules SET Price = 1450, ArrivalTime = DATEADD(HOUR, 6, DepartureTime) WHERE ScheduleId = 4;
