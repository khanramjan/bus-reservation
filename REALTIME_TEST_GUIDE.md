Banner:  ‚úì Jane Smith just booked 2 seat(s)! 43 seats left
```

## üìä Multiple Booking Test

### Try This Scenario:

1. **Window 1 & 2**: Both search same route
2. **Window 1**: Book 2 seats
   - Watch Window 2: Seats decrease ‚úì
3. **Window 2**: Book 1 seat
   - Watch Window 1: Seats decrease ‚úì
4. **Window 1**: Book 3 seats
   - Watch Window 2: Seats decrease ‚úì
   - Watch notification: Shows passenger name ‚úì

**Result**: Live updates working perfectly! üéâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Notification Not Appearing?
```
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for: "Booking confirmed notification received"
3. Verify SignalR connection status
```

### Seats Not Updating?
```
1. Verify both windows on same route/date
2. Refresh page (F5) to reset subscription
3. Check browser network tab:
   - Should see WebSocket connection
   - Look for "booking-hub"
```

### Backend Connection Failed?
```
1. Verify backend running: http://localhost:5000/swagger
2. Check firewall allowing localhost:5000
3. Restart backend: Ctrl+C, then dotnet run
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **See Both Updated Simultaneously**: 
   - Book simultaneously from both windows to see multiple notifications

2. **Test Connection Recovery**:
   - Stop backend, then restart
   - Watch frontend automatically reconnect
   - Notifications resume working

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Keep DevTools ‚Üí Network tab open
   - Notice WebSocket stays connected
   - See real-time updates <500ms

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Try booking 6 seats (max limit)
   - Try invalid phone number
   - Try cancelling a booking
